1. The MySQL backup cron job has been successfully deployed.

2. The cron job is scheduled to run at 7:00 AM UTC daily.

3. You can check the status of the CronJob with the following command:
   kubectl get cronjob mysql-backup -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

4. To view the logs of the most recent job run, use the following command:
   kubectl logs -l job-name=$(kubectl get jobs --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp -o jsonpath='{.items[-1].metadata.name}') -c backup

5. The backups are uploaded to the S3 bucket with the following path structure:
   s3://{{ .Values.bucket.name }}/{{ .Values.bucket.prefix }}/<namespace>-<database_name>-<date>.sql

6. Ensure that the ServiceAccount has the necessary permissions to upload to the S3 bucket. The role ARN used is:
   {{ index .Values.serviceAccount.annotations "eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn" }}

7. To manually trigger the backup job for testing, you can create a job from the cron job template:
   kubectl create job --from=cronjob/mysql-backup manual-backup-$(date +%s)
